Special IDE created only for coding with `Lumen`

This "language" was "created" for school purposes. Because of that, it is very, very simple, so please don't try to code next Cyberpunk. 
It was based on this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eythq9848Fg&list=PLZQftyCk7_SdoVexSmwy_tBgs7P0b97yD&index by CodePulse.

> You have two versions of the editor: **editor.py** and **editorbeta.py**. 
> Below are the differences between the two.
> You will most likely want to use the stable editor.py version.

> Sadly I couldn't attach/upload node_modules files

> **Note**: editor.py is the more reliable and stable version, whereas editorbeta.py 
> includes experimental features that might not work consistently and is subject to frequent changes.

> and some syntax differences! (in Lumen):

- instead of `ELIF` you have `OTHER` <br>
- instead of `RETURN` you have `BACK` <br>
- instead of `END` you have `STOP` <br>
- instead of `FUN/DEF` you have `FUNC` <br>
- instead of `VAR` you have `SET` <br>
